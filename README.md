# keras-inceptionV4
Keras implementation of Google's inception v4 model

As described in http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.07261.Inception-v4

Inception-ResNet and the Impact of Residual Connections on Learning (Christian Szegedy, Sergey Ioffe, Vincent Vanhoucke, Alex Alemi)

Note this Keras implementation tries to follow the [tf.slim definition](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/slim/nets/inception_v4.py) as closely as possible.

If you find any typos or bugs in the definition please make an issue or a pull request so we can get it fixed!
